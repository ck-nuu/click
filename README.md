Depending on the admin settings rights of your windows device, the device will lock after a set period. 
It is very fustrating if you can't change the time to keep your device from locking automatically. 
This piece of powershell code will keep your device active for any duration (my prefered time is 4hrs),
keeping your windows device active even without touching the mouse
